The process of running it is the same.
1. The prediction interval is the MARKOV_PREDICTION_INTERVAL in the config file
2. The time step  is TIME_STEP 
3. The results is the MeanAbsoluteError.txt and the MeanSquaredError.txt files

How does it do the prediction?
e.g at interval of 10:

pick data from 0-9 and predict 10-19, then evaluate on actual 10-19
discard data from 0-9
pick data from 10-19, and predict 20-29 then evaluate on actual 20-29
discard data from 20-29
